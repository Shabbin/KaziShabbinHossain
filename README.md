# Kazi Shabbin Hossain — Personal Portfolio

This repository contains my personal portfolio project, focused on interaction design, motion, and UX-driven structure.  
It reflects how I approach evolving real-world codebases rather than building purely static demos.

---

## Origin & Ownership

This project started from a publicly available starter repository shared by a YouTube creator.  
It was used only as an initial scaffold to avoid repetitive setup and boilerplate.

I did **not** follow a step-by-step tutorial or guided instructions.

From the beginning, development was driven by my own design, UX, and implementation decisions, including:

- Custom layout and section structure
- Rebuilt navigation and menu interactions
- Original animation logic and motion timing
- Visual redesign and styling choices
- Incremental refactoring as the project evolved

The current codebase represents my independent work and ongoing iteration built on top of an initial foundation.

## What This Project Demonstrates

- Ownership over an existing codebase
- UX-first thinking and interaction design
- Motion and animation using Framer Motion
- Component-driven architecture in React / Next.js
- Iterative problem-solving over time

## Testimonials & Feedback (Early Stage)

This portfolio intentionally does not display fake testimonials.

A feedback system is in place to collect private input, which may be displayed publicly in the future **only with permission** and always attached to real projects and real people.

## Status

Actively evolving.  
Built to grow alongside real client work and feedback.
